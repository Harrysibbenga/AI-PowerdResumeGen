# Fixed: DefaultForm Section Loading Issue

## Problem Identified:
The `defaultForm` had `includeProjects: true`, `includeCertifications: true`, and `includeLanguages: true`, but these sections weren't displaying in the form.

## Root Cause:
The normalization logic in `normalizeApiResponse()` was:
1. Starting with `createEmptyFormStructure()` (all includes = `false`)
2. Processing arrays and overriding include flags based on array length
3. Not preserving the original explicit include flags from `defaultForm`

## Fix Applied:

### 1. Set Include Flags Early (Line 145-152)
```javascript
// IMPORTANT: Set include flags from original data FIRST
normalized.includeProjects = apiData.includeProjects ?? normalized.includeProjects
normalized.includeCertifications = apiData.includeCertifications ?? normalized.includeCertifications  
normalized.includeLanguages = apiData.includeLanguages ?? normalized.includeLanguages
```

### 2. Only Auto-Set When Not Explicit (Lines 219-241)
```javascript
// Only auto-set include flags if they weren't explicitly provided
const hasExplicitIncludeProjects = apiData.includeProjects !== undefined
if (!hasExplicitIncludeProjects && normalized.projects.length > 0) {
  normalized.includeProjects = true
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Original include flag values from `defaultForm`
- Whether flags are explicit or auto-generated
- Final normalized state

## Expected Result:
Now when `defaultForm` loads:
- ✅ `includeProjects: true` → Projects section shows
- ✅ `includeCertifications: true` → Certifications section shows  
- ✅ `includeLanguages: true` → Languages section shows
- ✅ All test data (projects array, languages array) loads properly

## Debug Console Output:
When you refresh the form, you should see:
```
Include flags from original data:
- includeProjects: true -> true
- includeCertifications: true -> true  
- includeLanguages: true -> true

FINAL NORMALIZED DATA:
- Projects: 2 items, include: true
- Languages: 3 items, include: true
- Certifications: 3 items, include: true
```
